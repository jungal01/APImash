      <h1>Sometimes it's necessary to tell someone to fuck off.</h1>
      <h2>And sometimes, that person might not speak English.</h2>
      <p>That shouldn't stop you though, which is why you have come here.
        Regardless of the language they may speak, you can express how you
        really feel with this handy API.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> in the <b>action</b> field, enter an
        action this piece of trash should be doing. In the <b>name</b> field,
        place the name of this "person". In the <b>from</b> field, place the
        name of person filled with righteous anger. <br /> Not every field will get
        used every time the content is created, but the <b>from</b> must be filled,
        and it's useful to fill them all, as the content is randomly generated.
        Once the fields are filled out to your pleasure, hit the generate button
        to create the content. Then select the language you would like to translate
        to and hit translate button.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Important info: the server likes to hang, so in the event that the English doesn't generate, hit <code>ctrl+f5</code>.
        Not all languages have been assigned their proper name, some are still in their ISO 639-1 codes, as the associative array is
        huge (nearly all of the ones on google translate!) and one dev can only do so much. However, that will limit
        the choices of languages down to the options that have their proper name.</p>
